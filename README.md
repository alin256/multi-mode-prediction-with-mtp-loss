# A multi-trajectory-prediction loss implementation in PyTorch

This is our customized implementation of the multi-trajectory-prediction (MTP) loss introduced in [cui2019multimodal](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10732) in PyTorch. The source code was developed for the paper [alyaev2021direct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01871) (see below).
